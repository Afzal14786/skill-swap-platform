# How to set up locally  

**Step 1:**  
Copy this link for cloning the project into your local machine :   
```markdown
https://github.com/Afzal14786/skill-swap-platform.git
```
**Step 2:**  
Move to you local machine inside **/project** and open this folder in VS Code and open terminal and run this command :  
```markdown
git clone <paste copied link> 
```

**Step 3:**  
now run `npm i` because all the dependies are already inside **package.json**, so in your machine too all the dependies will install.
